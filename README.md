# More BigQuery with Python

- Hello!

- The title seemed logical at the time. ("More" because I used "BigQuery with Python" as the title for a BigQuery guide I followed.)

- **[This is the Jupyter Notebook file which has the queries with their graphs.](https://github.com/Coletterbox/More-BigQuery-with-Python/blob/main/dashboardDraft1.ipynb)**

- **The project ID is a string (project_id) declared in projectIDContainer.py; I'll need to remember to send that with the copy I'm sending you, because it's in the .gitignore.**

- Anything in this folder that isn't linked here and sounds like a draft is just a draft that isn't really necessary to look at. I was creating new iterations while having the old version on the left and the current version on the right.

- I hope you have as much fun with this as I had making it! I mean, probably not, because making it is the more fun part, but anyway...
