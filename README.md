# More BigQuery with Python
## The title seemed logical at the time. ("More" because I used "BigQuery with Python" as the title for a BigQuery guide I followed.)

## The project ID is a string (project_id) declared in projectIDContainer.py; I'll need to remember to send that to you because it's in the .gitignore.
